# Kanto Field Guide

A Game Boy–styled fan site that guides you through the early Kanto region from Pokémon. Built with the classic four-color Game Boy palette (dark green, medium green, light green, and pale green), pixel-perfect sprites, and the "Press Start 2P" font, it recreates the look and feel of exploring Kanto on the original handheld.

## How to Navigate

Suggested path through the guide:

1. **Map** → Start at the Town Map to choose your destination
2. **Pallet Town** → Meet Professor Oak and choose your starter Pokémon
3. **Route 1** → Encounter wild Pokémon in the tall grass
4. **Pewter Gym** → Battle Brock and earn the Boulder Badge
5. **Pokédex** → Review all Pokémon encountered on your journey
